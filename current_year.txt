variable $today is incorrect, I suppose. It stores timestamp of YESTERDAY, instead of today. 

When it was 27-09-19 11:28 MSK (04:28 EDT)
it shows 26-09-2019 00:00:00


In every SQL-query there are useless conditions like "where o.date_added > 0" and "o.order_status_id != '4' ".


Today (placed): 

  $count_install_today, $value_install_today:

    Counts all orders from the beginning of current day.

  $countCC, $valueCC

    Counts all orders from the beginning of current day.
    where order_status_id != '4' and order_type_id = '1' and billing_method_id = '1'

Month (placed): 

  $count_install_month, $value_install_month

    Counts orders, where date_added (table 'orders') starts from the beginning of month (e.g. 01-09-2019 00:00:00) and until the beginning of tomorrow (e.g. 27:09:19 00:00:00).

Month (completed): 

  $this_month_complete_count, $this_month_complete_value:

    Counts all orders between the month first date (e.g. 01-09-19 00:00:00) and the beginning of tomorrow (e.g. 27-09-19 00:00:00). Where order_type_id = '1' and order_status_id = '3'

Previous Month (completed): 

  IMPORTANT!!!
  I think there is also a mistake. The previous month in SQL-queries is actually Current month. "01-09-19 00:00:00"
  Ant the end of the previous month is the beginning of next month. "01-10-19 00:00:00"
